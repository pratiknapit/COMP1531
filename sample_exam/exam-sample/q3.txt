Q. Describe they difference between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment. For each, provide an clear and specific example of their usage.

Continuous delivery is being agile enough to be ready and able to release any version at any time on any platform. It allows accepted code changes to 
be deployed to customers quickly and sustainably. For example, continuous delivery involves the automation of the release process so we can acheive a streamlined,
automated software release process.

Continuous deployment is an extension of Continuous Delivery whereby changes attempt to flight towards production automatically, and the only thing stopping them
is a failed test. An example of continous deployment is building a pipeline in plcace where teams can react to customer feedback in real time, developers can design and develop then test, and 
deploy very quickly as the deployment is automated.
