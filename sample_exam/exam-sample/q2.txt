Q. Break the following elicited requirements into a list of atomic dot points. Remove or consolidate any unnecessary or distracting information.

How could we clean this up into well described requirements? "I want a burger with lots of pickles and mayo but I need to make sure that the mayo doesn't make the burger bun really wet. 
Oh, and it needs to be warm, like, made less than 5 minutes ago warm but not so hot that I burn myself.
I'm also not a big fan of plastic containers so if it could be in a paper bag that would be good. Actually, make that a brown paper bag, I like the colour of that"
