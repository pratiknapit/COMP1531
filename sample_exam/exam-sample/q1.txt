Q. Describe and justify 3 attributes of good requirements.

1. Resuability is an important attribute of good requirements because we need to be able to use code many times instead of repeating code.
2. Maintanability is the ease in which an existing code can be changed. It is important because the easier we can make changes, the better.
3. Robustness is another good requirement in designing software, as a system needs to work given invalid inputs and different conditions.
