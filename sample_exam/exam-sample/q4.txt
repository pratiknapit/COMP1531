JSON and YAML are two different types of data transfer objects. YAML can be more readbale than JSON although JSON is often faster and more interoperable with more systems.
JSON is much more explicit and strict than YAML, it is a very popular format for tramsittinng data over http.

For JSON, no training commas allowed, and whitespace is ignored. In Json a key in double quotes is used to begin a item. 

For YAML, indentation matters and a dash is used to begin a list item.
